Hi, I'm McKay Christensen. I've just recently signed up for this site, so I'm trying to figure out how to get around. I've been in a coding class for almost a year now, and still trying to master the basics.
In the future I'd like to be a game designer, working with either some friends or a whole team on the next greatest game.
